# Ignite Shop

Ignite Shop is a fictional e-commerce web application developed with Next.js. It's the fourth challenge of [Rocketseat's](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/) React.js course.

Working on this project allowed me to put into practice some core web concepts, such as Server Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG).

## About the project

![home-page](https://github.com/bernardodemarco/ignite-shop/assets/115510880/49fbe643-15e5-4b04-a803-297566f807a5)

On the application's main page, the user can navigate through all available products. Once a product is clicked, the user is redirected to a page that shows its specifications. Inside, there is a button that adds this specific product to the cart.

The user can view the cart status by clicking on the bag icon. In the cart, the number of items and the total price are displayed.

When the user clicks on the button to complete the purchase, they are redirected to the [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-br) custom page. If the payment is successfully completed, the user is redirected to a success page.

It is possible to simulate payments by using **_4242 4242 4242 4242_** as the card number. The security code can be any random three digits, such as **_123_**.
